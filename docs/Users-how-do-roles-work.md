# How do user roles work with our classified ads script?

At some stage after the development of your classifieds website, you will need to  **delegate other people to do some work**  for you, from translation and content creation to moderation and website administration.

With our open source classifieds script you could do that easily! Letâ€™s do an example of setting things up for a person, whom we will delegate to create content on our classifieds website.

1.  First go to your classifieds website  **Admin Panel**
2.  Go to  **Users**  >  **Roles**
3.  Create a  **New Role**  and press  **Submit**

4.  **Edit**  the newly created role  
5. You will find a long list of  **privileges**, pick the ones you need to give access to and press  **Update**  Have the person helping you can  **create a new user**  or you can create one for him.
6.  Go to  **Users**  >  **Users**  in your  **Admin Panel**
7.  Edit the account
8.  Change the role to the new one you created
9.  Done!
