 Integrate LogBee delivery services into your website in a few simple steps.
 1. Go to your **admin panel** -> **Configure** -> **Integrations** ->  find **Social** and click on **Logbee**
 2. Create an account on [Logbee's official website](https://www.logbee.com/login?1). It's free!
 
 1 and 2 steps are interchanged. We have to make sure customer has account with Logbee before proceeding with steps. 

1. If you do not have an account with Logbee yet, please create an account on Logbee's official website (https://www.logbee.com/). 
2. Go to your admin panel -> Configure -> Integrations -> find Social and click on Logbee

 3. The next step is to install  **logmarklet**  or use a browser button for Chrome, ( soon on Forefox and Safari too!), which will later allow you to easily store your favorite ads into your Logbee account. Just drag the 'log it' button below onto your browser's bookmark bar.
